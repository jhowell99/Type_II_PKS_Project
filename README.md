# Type_II_PKS_Project
 
1. AlphaFold_models
  + The AlphaFold outputs for the three chosen sequences as well as the 6 sequence mutated models
  + For Model 1-6, there are additional files containing the structures with altered rotamers
2. CASTp
  + The folders contain [CASTp](http://sts.bioe.uic.edu/castp/calculation.html) data, all using 1.1 as the radius
  + There is also a jupyter notebook along with two .csv files to generate some plots
3. Chen_et_al_SI.xlsx
  + The SI from [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.202202286)
  + Contains data for all type II PKS with known sequences and products (as of 6/4/22)
4. ConSurf
  + Contains ConSurf runs for the three clades, as well as for the entire dataset, each with the correct reference sequence
  + To visualise colours,
